# Thinkit Mobile App ðŸ‘‹

This is a virtual number generator mobile app built using React Native and Expo. It uses an API I built using Laravel Sanctum for Number generation and User authentication.

# Features

1. Login and Signup
2. Generate virtual number from USA and Nigeria (not real numbers)
3. Different numbers services to choose from
4. Each service cost different amount of credits
5. History Tab
6. Profile Update
7. Dark and Light Theme

When you choose Nigeria for example, a list of services you can generate numbers from is then loaded and you can select any one and generate a number for it if you have sufficient credits to do so.
